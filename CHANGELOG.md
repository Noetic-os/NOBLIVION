# Changelog

All notable changes to NOBLIVION. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-04

Fixes from the fresh-install test of 0.1.0. After the plugin update, run
the install command that the first session prints, because the store venv
must be rebuilt for 0.1.1.

### Fixed

- The MCP tool `noblivion_recall` answered `store_down` in every session.
  `.mcp.json` passed the literal text `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` to the MCP
  server. The `env` block is gone: Claude Code sets the variable by itself.
  A data dir value that still holds `${` now counts as unset. A test fails
  on any variable in the plugin JSON files that Claude Code does not expand
  in that field. The MCP server reports the plugin version. (NOBLIVION-24)
- A store that could not start was silent. The store now logs the bind
  error with its reason and writes it to `<data dir>/store.error`.
  `noblivion ensure-running` waits up to 10 seconds for the store, prints
  `failed` with the reason and exits with code 1. The SessionStart hook
  shows one line with the reason. (NOBLIVION-25)
- The data dir could be mode 0775 when Claude Code made it before the
  install. `install.sh`, the SessionStart hook, the launcher and the store
  now set it to 0700, and the hooks make their folders with mode 0700.
  (NOBLIVION-27)
- The first session of a fresh install printed
  `guard table: rebuild failed: memory folder ... does not exist`. No
  memory folder now means no guards, with no error line. (NOBLIVION-27)

### Changed

- The default store port is `0`: the system picks a free port, and the
  hooks read it from `store.json`. The fixed port 8894 was taken on a test
  host. Set `port` in `config.json` to use a fixed port. (NOBLIVION-25)
- The uninstall steps keep the database by default. `uninstall.sh` and
  `docs/install.md` now say to run
  `claude plugin uninstall noblivion --keep-data`, and say that without
  `--keep-data` Claude Code deletes the whole data dir, the database
  included. (NOBLIVION-26)
- The install docs use the HTTPS URL for `marketplace add` (the short form
  `<owner>/NOBLIVION` can clone over SSH) and show the terminal commands
  `claude plugin marketplace add`, `claude plugin install` and
  `claude plugin list`. (NOBLIVION-27)

## 0.1.0 - 2026-10-03

First release.

- The Claude Code plugin: hooks for recall, guards, stop checks,
  continuity, memory sync, the trust flush, the store start and the
  transcript miner; the MCP tool `noblivion_recall`.
- The local store: SQLite, keyword and optional vector search, served on
  `127.0.0.1` with a token handshake.
- Trust scoring, the transcript miner and opt-in dedup.
- `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/uninstall.sh` and
  `noblivion migrate-from-legacy`.
